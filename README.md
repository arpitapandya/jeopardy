Its' Jeopardy

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax.

API used http://jservice.io/

-- Requirements
.   Get a bunch of categories, and keep randomly choosing one, making sure you don’t choose the same one twice.

.   The game board should be 6 categories across, 5 question down, displayed in a table. Above this should be a header row with the name of each category.

.   At the start of the game, you should randomly pick 6 categories from the jService API. For each category, you should randomly select 5 questions for that category.

.   Initially, the board should show with ? on each spot on the board (on the real TV show, it shows dollar amount, but we won’t implement this).

.   When the user clicks on a clue ?, it should replace that with the question text.

.   When the user clicks on a visible question on the board, it should change to the answer (if they click on a visible answer, nothing should happen).
